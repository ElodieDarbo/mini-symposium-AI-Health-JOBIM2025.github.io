# Mini-symposium JOBIM 2025: AI in Healthcare: From Fundamentals to the Clinic

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the landscape of modern medicine, from early diagnosis to personalized treatment and clinical decision support. This mini-symposium, "AI in Healthcare: From Fundamentals to Clinic," aims to explore the real-world impact of AI in clinical environments, with a particular focus on its integration into diagnostic and therapeutic workflows in hospitals.

Bringing together researchers, clinicians, and AI experts, the event fosters interdisciplinary dialogue around both the opportunities and the challenges posed by AI. Topics will include methodological rigor, regulatory requirements (such as accreditation standards like COFRAC), and the evolving role of healthcare professionals in an increasingly data-driven environment.

Through expert talks and a closing panel discussion, this symposium seeks to bridge the gap between innovation and clinical reality â€” questioning not only what AI can do for healthcare, but how it should be implemented responsibly, effectively, and ethically.
